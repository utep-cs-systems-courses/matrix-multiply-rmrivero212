## Program Description and instructions

The file "MatrixMultiply.py" contains a function as well as a main that tests
the capabilities of the matrixMultiply algorithm. Within the main the time is
taken from the start to finish of calling the matrixMultiply method.

To run the program and view results simply type:
       	   	       	    $ python3 MatrixMutliply.py
	This will run the program, multiply the given matrices, then output
       	   	       	    the computational time in monotonic time.
